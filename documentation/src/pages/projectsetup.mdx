# SETTING UP THE PROJECT

The project consists of multiple parts that needs to be set up. This guide will help you set up the project.

## Architecture of the system

![Untitled-2024-06-23-1246](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7625c1f4-296d-4974-a252-89c482c26b7c)

For the project to start, we need to setup all 3 parts of the project & the reverse proxy:

1. reverse proxy (NGINX) [Installation Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/)
2. infra_be
3. ws_be
4. app

:::info
For local setup, you need to have a virtual machine which acts as the **Docker Host** & your PC will act as the **SSH Proxy** as shown in the architecture diagram.
:::

## Setting up the project
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux" default>
## Pre-requisites

1. A virtual machine with Docker installed & ssh with **PermitRootLogin** enabled (PermitRootLogin is not required if the user has permissions run docker commands). You can use [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) for virtual machine.
2. Your pc with ssh enabled. Also your PC and Virtual machine should use ssh key based authentication. [Read Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server)
3. TCP remote access of docker daemon in virtual machine should be enabled. [Read Here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/remote-access/#configuring-remote-access-with-systemd-unit-file)
4. A PostgreSQL database. It can be in container in you PC docker,[Neon DB](https://neon.tech/) or any.

> **Assuming pre-requisites are met, now we should have these things available:**
>
> 1. IP address of virtual machine (Docker Host) with ssh keys. For this doc, lets assume the IP address is `192.168.122.2` & the TCP of docker daemon is listening on port `2375`
> 2. PostgreSQL database with credentials. For this doc lets assume the database is running on `localhost:5432` with username `postgres` & password `postgresql`
> 3. ssh address of your pc `127.0.0.1`

## Setting up the Reverse Proxy

We use NGINX as reverse proxy. You can use any other as long as the http requests are forwarded to the `app` & websocket requests are forwarded to the `ws_be`.

1. Edit the `nginx.conf` file at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` & add the following configuration in the http block:

```plaintext title="http block in the file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
server {
    listen *:4000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    add_header X-Served-By $host;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000$request_uri;
    }

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000$request_uri;
    }
}
```

then restart the nginx service.

## Setting up the SSH config
The project uses some commands which rely on you already setting up the ssh config. You need to create a ssh config in the `SSH Proxy server` to access `Docker Host`.
In local setup you PC is acting as the SSH proxy server and the VM is acting as the Docker Host.
So create a ssh config file in your PC. If this `~/.ssh/config` file does not exist, create it or if it already exists add the content in it. 

```plaintext title="~/.ssh/config"
Host dockerhost
    HostName 192.168.122.2 # IP address of the Docker Host which is your VM
    User username
    IdentityFile /home/user/.ssh/ssh_key.pem # Path to the ssh key file
``` 

After setting this up, you can directly use this command in terminal to ssh into the VM.

```bash
ssh dockerhost
```
:::important
Setting `Host dockerhost` in the ssh config is important as the project uses this name in the scripts.
:::

## Setting up the app
This part of the project is a NextJS application which is responsible for the frontend and backend of the project. 
### 1. Create `.env` file

Make a copy of `.env.example` file as `.env` & fill the variables. Database is already setup. Now you need the google oauth credential. [Read Here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2). While creating oauth credential `Authorized JavaScript origins` should be http://localhost:4000 & `Authorized redirect URIs` should be http://localhost:4000/api/auth/callback/google.

For cloudflare DNS setup, you need to have cloudflare account. You can ignore this if you do not plan to use `inbound_rules` in local setup. so you can ignore the `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` & `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` variables in `.env` as well.

change the `DATABASE_URL` with your database url and credentials.

```env title=".env"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgresql@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public"
AUTH_SECRET="6WTL7JUvFUnxhXh91zA+0P1qXhS0FV1bHH9gpVedWeA="
INFRA_BE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
ORACLE_NODE_IP="11.0.0.1" # It will be the IP address of the docker host in production environment, not relevant in dev environment
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID="..............." # Required
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET="..............." # Required
CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="..............."
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY="..............."
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID="..............."
```

### 2. Installing dependencies
cd into the `app` directory of the project and run this command.
:::important
The project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. Install it you don't already have.
:::

```bash
pnpm i
```

### 3. Setting up the database
This project is using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as ORM. To setup the database `cd` into the `app` directory of the project & run the following commands:

1. Creating schema in the database

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma db push
```

2. Generate prisma client

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```

3. Seeding the database with initial data

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma db seed
```

## Setting up infra_be
This part of the project is a python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application.
Any docker infrastructure(containers,network,volumes etc.) that needs to be created is created by this part.
That is why it is named as infra_be. It uses [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) under the hood. We will use python virtual environment to setup this part.
cd into. cd into `infra_be` directory of the project and run these commands.
### 1. Create virtual environment
Run the following command in your terminal. It will create the virtual environment and activates it.

```bash 
mkdir caas_pvenv && python3 -m venv caas_pvenv && source caas_pvenv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. setting up the `hosts` file
`infra_be` uses `inventory/hosts` file to connect to DockerHost & SSH proxy server. Edit the file according to your setup. 

change the ip address of the `docker_host` to the ip of the VM and also the values of `ansible_user` & `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` as well.
You can set `ansible_user` value other than root if the other user has access to work with docker. 

ssh_proxy is your pc on which you are running the project, so fill the values of `ansible_user` & `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` accordingly.

```plaintext title="inventory/hosts"
[docker_host]
192.168.122.2 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/anish/.ssh/github_pri

[ssh_proxy]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=anish ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/anish/.ssh/github_pri

```

## Setting up ws_be

### 1. Installing dependencies
cd into the `ws_be` directory of the project and run this command.

```bash
pnpm i
```

### 2. `.evn` file
copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` .
if address & port of the docker host(vm) is already `192.168.122.2` & docker daemon is listening on port `2375` no need to do any change.

```env title=".env"
DOCKER_API_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.122.2:2375"
```
